					<h3 id="general">General</h3>
					<p><b>When are the games?</b><br />
					Rampage games are on Fridays 7PM EST, Dominate on Saturdays and Champions on Sunday at the same times. Summer split starts on the weekend of July 14th, 2017.<br />
					<b>Which teams are going to be streamed?</b><br />
					The streaming schedule is under "Schedule and Standings" in each of the leagues' tabs. The teams are generally announced on the Monday of the week, group a and b alternate between getting streamed on the <a href="http://twitch.tv/risen_esports">main channel</a> and the <a href="http://twitch.tv/risen_esports2">secondary channel</a>.<br />
					<b>Will we get VODS and highlights for the streamed games? If so, where?</b><br />
					Yes! We try to get it done 1 or 2 days after the games get streamed! It shows up on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_X5UQq2ewiN4b1nyyDRAbA">Youtube channel</a> along with other awesome content! <br />
					<b>When does The RI5EN come out each week?</b><br />
					The RI5EN top plays come out every Wednesday, highlighting the plays in the previous week. If you saw any outstanding plays, all you need to do is clip it on Twitch.tv and the rest is up to us!

					<h3 id="tm">Team Management</h3>
					<p><b>Are we allowed to swap roles with other players if we want to? </b><br />
					Yes you are, you’re permitted to swap roles however you want before the season, HOWEVER, during the season you’re only allowed 3 role swaps. Swapping back to your original counts as another swap. <br />
					<b>How many subs can we have? </b><br />
					You’re allowed 2 designated subs, however other people can still sub for you. At the moment, there’s not a huge point in having “dedicated” subs unless they’re committed to your team. Any sub can be used as long as they fit the Sub Rule (no more than 3 divisions higher compared to original player). <br />
					<b>When do we need to confirm subs by? </b><br />
					Subs must be confirmed 2 days before your match. For rampage, that means Wednesday, and for Dominate Thursday. This is to ensure that the enemy team has ample time to scout and prepare for what they’re going to face. All subs must be approved by admins via Discord.<br />
					<b>Can our coach watch our games?</b><br />
					Yes they can! However, our one rule with coaches wanting to watch your games is that your team must then be in a discord channel within Risen itself, NO PERSONAL CHANNELS. The coach must have their mic muted, however they can record comms/record the game if they’d like. This is to ensure that things like pink ward locations cannot be given away to give a team an advantage.<br />
					<b>Are we allowed to kick players?</b><br />
					Typically admins will stay out of team conflicts unless it’s brought to us that a player is being harassed or otherwise treated unfairly. If the situation is severe enough, we will kick a player for you. However, if your team has good reason to on your own (a player is toxic, a player is refusing to cooperate, etc.) bring proof to admins before kicking them. <br />
					<b>What if a team has a smurf? </b><br />
					If a team has a smurf, or at least you believe they do, please PM an admin with evidence and reasoning and we will look into it. We will handle the punishment, not you, so please don’t start a witch hunt for the other person otherwise you’ll be the one in trouble.<br />
					<b>What if we can’t make a game time?</b><br />
					That’s okay! Talk to the enemy captain and set up a different time to play the match. Unfortunately, not always will the enemy team be able to reschedule, so a small number of times you have to take the FF. There will be plenty of time to make up matches though. <br />
					<b>What if we have a sub(s) that we didn’t check with you guys in time?</b> <br />
					If the sub is okayed by us after the deadline, they may still be used but at the price of 1 ban. This ban will be the first ban of champion select, and you can ban Aatrox/Urgot etc. to pass the time quicker (if the enemy team doesn’t want that champion).<br />
					<b>Are we allowed to climb during the season?</b> <br />
					Yes you are! We encourage you to climb as high as you possibly can. However, based off past experiences in last season, we’ve decided to hard cap Rampage at Gold 3(tentative, could be gold 2), and Dominate at Diamond 4. You’re welcome to climb to those ranks, however if you’re any higher, you will lose your ability to play with your team in your respective league. This is to ensure that the competitive nature of the league remains intact.
					</p>

					<h3 id="pb">Pick/Ban</h3>
					<p><b>Where do we do pick/ban?</b><br />
					All pick/ban sessions must occur on prodraft.leagueoflegends.com. This is to ensure that each team has as equal of a playing ground for pick/ban as possible, as owning less champions isn’t as punishing. THIS LINK MUST BE SAVED, us admins review the links for every game so make sure that they’re labeled correctly as well.<br />
					<b>What if we choose the wrong champ/it bugs out on us?</b><br />
					It’s up to enemy captain discretion whether or not the pick can be altered, however 99% of the time the enemy team says okay. Make sure to tell them immediately after the error occurs and they’ll most likely say it’s okay. If a major bug occurs or you feel the enemy team is lying to get a different pick, take it up with an admin/staff member (plenty will be on during gametime).<br />
					<b>How do we do in client drafting then?</b><br />
					Easy! Just copy bans/picks from your game and make sure that everything is the same. If there’s a reason it’s not and it’s approved by both teams, make sure to include that in the postgame message about who won otherwise we’ll be confused.<br />
					<b>What settings should our lobby be?</b><br />
					Your lobby should be a custom game, with a password, that is tournament draft. This is to ensure that the pause function can be used. On top of that, spectators must be “lobby only”. Failure to follow that rule will result in punishment (this is to make sure friends/coach can’t spectate and give things away).<br />
					</p>

					<h3 id="ing">In-Game</h3>
					<p><b>Are we allowed to use all-chat during a game?</b><br />
					All-chat should only be used when it’s needed, such as communicating why a pause happened. Outside of that, all-chat should not be used. Any sort of flame/BM should be screenshotted and sent to admins immediately after the game.
					</p>

					<h3 id="pg">Postgame</h3>
					<p><b>How do we report our results?</b><br />
					After your series is over with, please take the pick/ban link (prodraft), and the match history link for every game and label them with what game they are, and then post those in the #dominate_match_results or #rampage_match_results. This allows us to verify the results of the game. If the enemy team FF’s, just post that in there.
					</p>

					<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
					<p><b>What are the future plans for Risen?</b><br />
					All of us admins love to dream big, and we have high hopes that Risen will continue to grow as a league. Regardless of how much it may grow, we will NEVER force you to pay for it, we simply have no interest in charging people to pay money for this service. We do it for you guys, not for money. In the future, we hope to add a 5v5 league that’s more competitive but less about meeting new people, we also hope to expand our team cap so that we fit hundreds, even thousands of players under our name. We will continue to recruit casters and streamers and make sure that the production quality steadily grows alongside that. Overall, expect everything to continue getting bigger and better, as we have no plans of stopping at all.
